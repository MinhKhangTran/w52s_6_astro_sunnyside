## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) - static site builder

### What I learned

- Text on top of images with grid (see Projects.astro)

```scss
.right_panel {
  display: grid;

  picture,
  img {
    grid-area: 1/1;
    width: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
  }
  .text {
    grid-area: 1/1;
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

- Using box-shadow to make a underline (see Features.astro)

```scss
.clr-primary {
  box-shadow: inset 0 -0.4rem hsl(var(--primary) / 0.5);
  &:hover {
    box-shadow: inset 0 -1.2rem hsl(var(--primary) / 1);
  }
}
```

- coloring svgs with css (see Footer.astro)

```scss
.socials {
  gap: 1.75rem;
  padding-top: 5.5rem;
  a svg path {
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
  }
  a:hover,
  a:focus {
    svg path {
      fill: hsl(var(--white));
    }
  }
}
```
